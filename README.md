# Warriors' Clash

## Description  
**Warriors' Clash** is a multiplayer game created as an assignment for RICRYM. In this game, players must eliminate the enemy to survive, wielding a shield and a sword. Players have two primary skills: attack and block. The game is currently a work in progress, with the potential for further development given more time.  

At the start of the game, players are presented with a **Character Select Mode**, where they can choose their character. After selecting, they enter a **Test Dummy Level** for practice. The actual gameplay begins in the next level. All of this can be accessed from the menu.
